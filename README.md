# kafka-springboot-concept-project
This repository contains two Spring Boot services using Kafka. Delivery Boy Service (Producer) sends random location coordinates to a Kafka topic, while User Service (Consumer) tracks these updates in real time. This project demonstrates producer-consumer communication, real-time data streaming, and event-driven architecture.
